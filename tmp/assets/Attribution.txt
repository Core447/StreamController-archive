The MediaPlugin.png image was put together by me.
The background is made by myself.

I made the following changes to the images:
    - play.png & next.png:
        - I inverted the colors to make the icon white
        - I changed the Color mode from indexed to RGB
        - I added a transparent border around the image
        - I flipped on of the next.png images in my image vertically
